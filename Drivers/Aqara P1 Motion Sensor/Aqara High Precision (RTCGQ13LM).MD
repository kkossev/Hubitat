## Aqara High Precision Motion Sensor (RTCGQ13LM)

This is a new thread for the Aqara High Precision Motion Sensor, that are supported by the **Aqara P1 Motion Sensor driver** initially published [here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/aqara-fp1-and-p1-motion-sensors/92987/63?u=kkossev). As this driver supports several different modles of Aqara motion sensors, mixing the updates and the comments for the different devices is somewhat confusing for most of the forum users so it was [decided](https://community.hubitat.com/t/aqara-fp1-and-p1-motion-sensors/92987/304?u=kkossev) to split the inital thread into several individual new threads.

The recommended method for installing this custom driver is to use the community Hubitat Package Manager [(HPM)](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-hubitat-package-manager-hubitatcommunity/94471), search for "Aqara P1 Motion Sensor" or by Tag 'Zigbee'.

For manual installation, the last stable version code is here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkossev/Hubitat/main/Drivers/Aqara%20P1%20Motion%20Sensor/Aqara_P1_Motion_Sensor.groovy
